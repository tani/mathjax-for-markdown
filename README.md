# MathJax for Markdown
![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/taniguchi.mathjax-for-markdown)

This is a plugin for the Markdown viewer of VSCode.
This plugin enables the LaTeX notation in Markdown such as `$x^2+y^2=z^2$`.

Compared to other math plugins of VSCode, our plugin has advantage on the following points.

- VSCode Web Extension, i.e., it is available on github.dev and vscode.dev
- MathJax v3 (KaTeX is not enough to use extra LaTeX packages such as bussproofs)
